The server1 code is a modified serverside tcp server code, that was obtained from the GeeksForGeeks website.
The client1 is exactly the same.
We first run the sever code on raspberry pi terminal and the run the client side code through SSH.
When we enter digits on the client side, it translates to a predifined function, which is called to implement 
the command according to the following key:
8- Forward.
2- Reverse.
6- Right.
4- Left.
5- Stop.
0- Horn.
